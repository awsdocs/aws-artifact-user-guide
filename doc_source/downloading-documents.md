# Downloading reports in AWS Artifact<a name="downloading-documents"></a>

You can download reports from the AWS Artifact console\. When you download a report from AWS Artifact, the report is generated specifically for you, and every report has a unique watermark\. For this reason, you should share the reports only with those you trust\. Don't email the reports as attachments, and don't share them online\. To share a report, use a secure sharing service such as Amazon WorkDocs\. Some reports require you to sign a nondisclosure agreement \(NDA\) before you can download them\.

## Downloading a report<a name="artifact-download-report"></a>

To download a report, you must have the required permissions\. For more information, see [Identity and access management in AWS Artifact](security-iam.md)\.

When you sign up for AWS Artifact, your account is automatically granted permissions to download some reports\. If you need to request access to another listed report, use the [provided form](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/access-request/) to request access from AWS\.

**To download a report**

1. Open the AWS Artifact console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/artifact/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/)\. 

1. On the AWS Artifact home page, choose **View reports**\.

1. \(Optional\) Enter a keyword in the search field to locate a report\.

1. Select a report, and then choose **Download report**\.

1. You might be asked to accept a nondisclosure agreement \(NDA\)\. This NDA is a legally binding contract\. We recommend that you read it closely\. When you are finished, select **I have read and agree to all the terms of the NDA** and then choose **Accept NDA and download**\.

1. Open the downloaded file using Adobe Acrobat Reader\. Read the **Terms and Conditions** section\. When you are finished, choose the paperclip icon in the left pane and open the attached PDF file\.

## Securing your documents<a name="artifact-best-practices"></a>

AWS Artifact documents are confidential and should be kept secure at all times\. AWS Artifact uses the AWS shared responsibility model for its documents\. This means that AWS is responsible for keeping documents secure while they are in the AWS Cloud, but you are responsible for keeping them secure after you download them\. AWS Artifact might require you to sign a nondisclosure agreement \(NDA\) before you can download documents\. Each document download has a unique, traceable watermark\.

You are only permitted to share documents marked as confidential within your company, with your regulators, and with your auditors\. You aren't permitted to share these documents with your customers or on your website\. We strongly recommend that you use a secure document sharing service, such as Amazon WorkDocs, to share documents with others\. Do not send the documents through email or upload them to a site that is not secure\.
