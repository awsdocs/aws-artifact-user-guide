# Downloading Documents<a name="downloading-documents"></a>

You can download documents from the AWS console\. When you download a document from AWS Artifact, the documented is generated specifically for you, and every document has a unique watermark\. For this reason, you should share the documents only with those you trust\. Do not email the documents as attachments, and do not share them online\. To share a document, use a secure sharing service such as Amazon WorkDocs\. Some documents require you to sign an NDA before you can download them\.

To download a document, you must have the appropriate permissions\. For more information about getting started, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)\.

**To download a document**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Artifact console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/artifact/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/)\.

1. On the **AWS Artifact** dashboard, choose **Reports**\.

1. Locate the report, and then choose **Get this artifact**\.

1. Read the **Terms and conditions** for the document\. You might be asked to sign an NDA to download the document\.
**Note**  
The **Nondisclosure Agreement** is a legally binding contract\. We recommend that you read it closely\.

1. After you have read the **Terms and Conditions**, select the checkbox at the bottom of the page, and then choose **Accept and download**\. AWS Artifact generates your file and opens it in another window\.

1. In the document window, choose **Save File** or **Open with** **Adobe Acrobat Reader**, and then choose **OK**\. Your document is downloaded to the specified location on your computer, or opened in Adobe Reader\.

## Getting Permissions For Additional Documents<a name="additional-permissions"></a>

When you sign up for AWS Artifact, you are automatically granted permissions to download some documents\. If you need to request access to another listed document, ask your account admin \(if you're an IAM user\) and include the ARN for the document that you are requesting access for, or request additional permissions from AWS \(if you're an admin\) using the [provided form](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/access-request/)\.
