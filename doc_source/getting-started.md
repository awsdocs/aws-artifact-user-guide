# Getting started with AWS Artifact<a name="getting-started"></a>

AWS Artifact provides a central resource for AWS security and compliance reports\. The artifacts available in AWS Artifact include Service Organization Control \(SOC\) reports, Payment Card Industry \(PCI\) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls\. AWS Artifact enables you to accept and manage legal agreements such as the Business Associate Addendum \(BAA\)\. If you use AWS Organizations, you can accept agreements on behalf of all accounts within your organization\. When accepted, all existing and subsequent member accounts are automatically covered by the agreement\.
